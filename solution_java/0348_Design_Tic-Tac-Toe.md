# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

## problem

Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Implement the TicTacToe class:

TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n.
int move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player with id player plays at the cell (row, col) of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.

Example 1:

Input
["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | | // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | | // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| | // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| | // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| | // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
player is 1 or 2.
0 <= row, col < n
(row, col) are unique for each different call to move.
At most n2 calls will be made to move.

## solution

you do need to use 2d array to store the board.
you can use rows[] and cols[] to store rows and cols in the board separately.

if you find each row or col have size equal to n, there is a tic-tac-toe here

by add value to each row, col, diagonal and antidiagonal with player==1 or player==-1

## code

```java
class TicTacToe {

    int[] rows;
    int[] cols;
    int diagonal;
    int antidiagonal;

    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        rows = new int[n];
        cols = new int[n];
    }

    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int n = rows.length;
        int addValue = (player==1? 1:-1);

        rows[row] += addValue;
        cols[col] += addValue;

        //index is at diagonal
        if(row==col)
            diagonal += addValue;
        //index is at antidiagonal
        if(row+col==n-1){
            antidiagonal += addValue;
        }

        if( Math.abs(rows[row])==n || Math.abs(cols[col])==n  ||  Math.abs(diagonal)==n  || Math.abs(antidiagonal)==n )
            return player;

        return 0;
    }


}
```
